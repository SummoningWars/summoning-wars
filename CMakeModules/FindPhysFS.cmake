# - Locate PhysFS library

#  PHYSFS_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link with
#  PHYSFS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to PHYSFS
#  PHYSFS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find PHYSFS/PHYSFS.h
#
# $PHYSFSDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$PHYSFSDIR
# used in building PHYSFS.

# Created by Eric Wing. This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake 
# module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks.

# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of 
# PHYSFS_LIBRARY to override this selection.
