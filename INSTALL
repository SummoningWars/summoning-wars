*********** General instructions ************************

Following libraries are required to build Summoning Wars:

OGRE >= 1.7.3
OIS
CEGUI >= 0.7.5
freealut, openal
lua5.1
ogg, vorbis, vorbisfile
physfs
POCO (for debug build only)

If you are lucky, all libs may be installed via package manager (apt-get, yum, emerge, pacman, ...).
Have a look at the "OS dependant install" section below.

After installing all required libraries type:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
sudo make install

Currently, there is no make install, so you have to start the game in the directory where you compiled it.
Please visit our Website www.sumwars.org to give some feedback or report bugs.

*********** OS dependant install tips *******************

Ubuntu:

Ogre 1.7 and CEGUI 0.7 are not included in the standard repositories yet. But you may get them from this additional repo:
https://launchpad.net/~andrewfenn/+archive/ogredev

To install all needed dependencies enter the following command into the terminal:
sudo apt-get install libogre-dev libcegui-dev libois-dev libalut-dev liblua5.1-0-dev libopenal-dev libvorbis-dev libfreeimage-dev libphysfs-dev

Then follow the "General instructions" section above to install the game.

*********** Troubleshooting *****************************

Problem: Rendering does not work under Windows:
Solution: Try replacing ogre.cfg by this (omit the last and the first line of course):

(Begin of ogre.cfg)
Render System=Direct3D9 Rendering Subsystem

[Direct3D9 Rendering Subsystem]

(End of ogre.cfg9)
