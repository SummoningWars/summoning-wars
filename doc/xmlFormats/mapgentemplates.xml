<!-- ObjectGroupTemplate is basically the same as an ObjectTemplate. Since ObjectGroups are composed of various objects, it has no type.
	Since ObjectGroupTemplates are used by the map generator and are predefined in the source code you can only replace these.
	You shouldn't temper with the template names and the shape, unless you know exactly, what you are doing (i.e. you rigged the source code itself.)

	<!-- Environments work the same as with ObjectTemplates, but the ObjectGroups should really fit into the shape and there shouldn't be empty environmants.
		You risk holes in the border of the regions otherwise.
