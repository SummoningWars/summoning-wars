<!-- An object Template consists of
	name: the unique name of the object_template. It has to be started by a "$"-character
	type: the type of the object (FIXED_OBJECT, SCRIPTOBJECT, TREASURE). It has to be the same for all real objects representing a template.
		The shape of the objects should be the same to actually make them replacements of one another.
-->
<ObjectTemplate name="$tree" type="FIXED_OBJECT">
	<!-- Every environment can hold a virtually infinit number of objects. One of them will replace a template randomly.
		default: An environment with this attribute will be used by every unknown environment.

	<!-- An empty envrionment leads to the template being not replaced by anything at all. This is useful if you have environments where the object would simply be out of place. -->
