#: tutorial.xml

msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml

msgid "No idea, but the Lord Master said that he speaks like this."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "No idea, but the Lord Master said that they speak like this."

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "What kind of sissy are you?"
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Are you looking for trouble, weakling?!"
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Wait a sec, Derred. They somehow seem stronger."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml

msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "You'd better think about who you're calling `weakling' here!"
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid ""
"Hm, right. The Lord Master said that something like this could happen. Do "

msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Explain level up?"

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Explain level up"

#: tutorial.xml

"You can upgrade your attributes every time, and sometimes you even have "

msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid ""

"They are filled with the unfathomable wisdom of Akeran and will soon be one of "

msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Of course. So, where?"
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Akeran protects, Akeran guides."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Look for a connection to a laboratory on the upper level."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "You can go there and... borrow one, if you're lucky."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml

"Just ask the master of the laboratory and he will surely give you one, if "

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Let's just try it out."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "So, this really is the lab, and that should be the crystal"
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "but there is no oh-so-blessed master here."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "Then he can't have any objections, can he?"
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "I'd better be careful, though."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid "This doesn't look like I can simply take it."
msgstr ""

#: tutorial.xml
msgid ""
"I guess I would first have to stop whatever is using the crystal right now."
