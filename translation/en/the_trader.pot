#: theTrader.xml

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Much to my regret, an Empty Scroll is only capable of one thing:"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "To establish a way through Harad's black abyss."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"To make it worse only to spots of great magical concentration like that "

msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml

"Furthermore, a scroll's power is depleted quickly and limited only to one "

"If you click on a road shrine, your body will be transported through Harad's "

msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"In your mind's eye you will see a map with all the waypoints you have "

msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "These are shown as small yellow points."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"If you have an open portal in the world, that will be shown too, with a red "

msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"Click on one of these symbols, and your body will rematerialize at your "

msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Hmm. You seem to know a great deal about this, for a trader."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"You pick these things up in your travels, except for business acumen, "
"apparently."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Clearly you are in the wrong line of work."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Be wary, it is not as safe around Medair as it used to be."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"Even travelling the roads may prove to be dangerous. Particularly if you are "

msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Goblins and other beasts have stolen quite a lot recently."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"You may find it convenient to make a short detour to a well-stocked trader."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Meaning yourself?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Actually not, regrettably."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"As reported, I invested badly in the Empty Scrolls and have no available "
"capital."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"I'm afraid I have insufficient gold to buy assorted wares from treasure "
"hunters and scavengers."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "But I can supply you with scrolls for a long time. That's a promise."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "One reason being; customers are rare in these parts."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"Surely they can be found anywhere, especially in a place like this."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "With all due respect, nobody wanting to buy scrolls from poor traders."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Regardless, not many Branded Ones would have listened to me as you have."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Allow me to give you an Empty Scroll as a gift."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Grace me with your presence again soon, if you please."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Wait! Does this thing have to be called Empty Scroll?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Why not town portal or something like that?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"Well, they were sold to me as Empty Scrolls, but what you call them is "
"entirely up to you."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Why not \"way to the town\" or something like that?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "What kind of name is that supposed to be!?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "How about: \"town portal\"?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Now, now, honorable customers!"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"They were sold to me as Empty Scrolls, but what you call them is entirely up "
"to you!"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "And how do we use them?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Like a common potion."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Explain the belt?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Well, you know about your inventory, right?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "I thought so."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"At the bottom you have the small items tab, click on it to access the three "
"rows of your small items inventory."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "The top row represents your belt."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "If you place a potion there, it appears in the belt row."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "I'm sure you noticed, right?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"Long years on the battlefield have honed my ability to change potions for "
"similar potions immediately once I have used one."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "A useful skill."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
" A common skill. Any sell-sword that wants to avoid a quick and meaningless "
"death knows of it."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Well, whatever."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"If you want to use a potion you can do so by clicking on it with the right "
"mouse button in the inventory or the belt."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Alternatively you can select the number of the belt slot it is in."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"That is, 1 for the potion on the left, 2 for the second from the left and so "
"on."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid ""
"This works for all usable items alike, so naturally for the scrolls, too."
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Oh! It's that simple?"
msgstr ""

#: theTrader.xml
msgid "Oddball."

msgid ""
"Well, I noticed you were headed north, and I thought it would be convenient "
