"I really stumbled across a scout in the goblin infested caves west of "
"Dwarfenwall. He is wounded, lost his gear to some spiders and asked me to "
"fix it for him. I really wonder if I should do this... then again it would "
"be an excuse to venture deeper into the caves that are obviously not under "
"control by the undead."
